However, dense reconstruction using a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) suffers from limitations in flight speed and battery power, resulting in slow reconstruction and low coverage. Cluster UAV systems offer greater flexibility and wider coverage for map building. Existing methods of cluster UAVs face challenges with accurate relative positioning, scale drift, and high-speed dense point cloud map generation. </p>","keywords":null,"cover":"/2023/04/03/ClusterFusion/ClusterFusion_cover.png","content":null,"text":" [Figure]  ","link":"","raw":null,"photos":[],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Paper","slug":"Paper","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Paper.json"}]}]}
