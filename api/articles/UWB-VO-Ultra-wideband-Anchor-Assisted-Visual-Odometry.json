The proposed approach utilizes UWB distance information to restore the scale of monocular SLAM with an error rate of less than 1%. Our approach joint optimizes the distance residual between the camera and anchor, and the reprojection error of the map point, to improve SLAM positioning accuracy and mitigate visual SLAM degradation in challenging environments. A novel UWB anchor position optimization method is proposed, which enables the system to complete initialization within 2 seconds. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion scheme achieves significantly higher accuracy in system scale estimation and positioning compared to current state-of-the-art SLAM and visual-inertial odometry algorithms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The architectural design of propose UWB+VO SLAM system with tight coupling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This paper proposes a SLAM method with a tightly coupled vision and UWB system that resolves two challenges associated with coupling UWB and vision. The proposed method achieves quick estimation of the anchor position through a two-stage initialization process, and continuously optimizes the anchor point position. By introducing joint optimization equations in the visual SLAM tracking and local map threads, the method establishes a tight coupling relationship between the distance constraint and the camera pose. Our main contributions include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The paper presents a filtering method for UWB measurement distance that removes inaccurate UWB measurements and resolves the challenge of short-term occlusion of UWB signals.</li>\n<li>We propose a novel two-stage initialization strategy that accomplishes both vision and system initialization. After the completion of visual initialization, the system scale and anchor position are optimized to promptly finalize the system initialization, effectively addressing the challenge of scale ambiguity in monocular visual SLAM.</li>\n<li>The paper proposes a joint optimization method for tight coupling of vision and UWB measurement information. In the tracking thread, the method adds the distance residual between the anchor point and the camera to the bundle adjustment equation to address the drift problem of visual SLAM. In the local map optimization thread, the joint optimization of the anchor point position, camera pose, and map point position improves the accuracy of SLAM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>​\t<img src=\"/2023/04/05/UWB-VO-Ultra-wideband-Anchor-Assisted-Visual-Odometry/handle_equipment.bmp\" class=\"\" title=\"[cover]\">\t</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Experiment in corridor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The full paper can be found <a href=\"\">here</a>.
