The front-end of the framework is an improved visual odometry which can effectively handle large-scale scenes. Collaborative localization between UAVs is enabled through a two-stage joint optimization algorithm and a relative pose optimization algorithm, effectively achieving accurate relative positioning of UAVs and mitigating scale drift. Estimated poses are used to achieve real-time dense reconstruction and fusion of point cloud maps. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on real-world data. The results demonstrate that our framework can effectively suppress scale drift and generate large-scale dense point cloud maps in real-time, with the reconstruction speed increasing as more UAVs are added to the system. </p>\n<img src=\"/2023/04/03/ClusterFusion/fig_wutai_path.png\" class=\"\" title=\"[Wutai]\">\n\n<p>A demo of dense reconstruction using multiple UAVs can be found in figure above and the architecture of this framework is shown in figure below. </p>\n<img src=\"/2023/04/03/ClusterFusion/fig_overview.png\" class=\"\" title=\"[Overview]\">\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ClusterFusion: The framework for dense reconstruction of multi-UAV.
